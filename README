# Funky B Compiler

This compiler was built for educational purpose. It is by no means a modern compiler, but it demostrates the basics in a small and mostly understandable way.

## Status

The front end of the compiler is completed to the point where a very inefficient ast tree is produced. I want to work more on improving the ast before moving to the backend. Operator
prescedence must be applied to the tree, and a lot of information is still present that may not be needed. This is a good stopping point, because I need to focus on another project.

## How To Build

Get yourself Make and a C++ compiler.
```
make
```

Pretty easy.

## How To Use

The compiler does not compile text files into binaries yet, but you can get lexer or parser outputs using the -dl and -dp flags.
```
./a.out test1.b -dp > parser_output.txt
```
